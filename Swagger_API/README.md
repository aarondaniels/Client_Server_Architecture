Go to http://localhost:5000/swagger/ to view API options. 

In order to get information from the Swagger API: 
1. Go to the `books` section and select `GET`
2. Select the `Try It Out` button followed by the `Execute` button
3. A Curl command will be generated where content from the API can be downloaded. Further, the code will be provided. This is likely the same code/data that is provided via cURL.
